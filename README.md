# Stress-Calendar
I created this for a class. 
The idea is that each project due for a class or an activity will take time T and intensity I

A 6 page paper that is about a fantasy story you need to write will take a while but not be super intense
A single hard math proof you might need to do might just take a short while, but will be harder, and you will know how difficult it will be

The system isn't perfect but it models your stress on a generated calendar over a semester for each project you input with parameters T and I
Each project begins to add stress several days before it is due, mostly weighted by how long it will take
The level of intensity is mainly weighted by Intensity. 

The projects overlap and it gets standardized based on maximum stress in the semester.
Given good data collection, either via the teacher's own data input and students reflecting after a semester on which assignments get which weights, a student would be able to accuratly model how stressful their semester will be at different points with the summation of stress from all their classes
	It might be good to add extra stress in overlapping dates. (More on your mind)

A teacher could also want to give a midterm but not know when best to do it out of two weeks, they could look at their student's average stress over the semester (with all of their student's calendars), and choose the week/day that overlaps the least with their students.
